# Multi-Tag

When installed, right-clicking on a folder will bring up an option to add a tag to all notes within a folder. Upon clicking this, a message will pop up asking you to add a tag. You may add your tag, and it will be appended to each note in the folder. Once confirming, the tag(s) will be added to the bottom of each note in the folder.

You can also select multiple notes with Shift+Mouse, and right-click the selection to get the same efect.

## Ideas for Features:

- [ ] Settings option for whether tag appears in YAML or bottom of file.

## Next Steps:

- [x] Update obsidian typing so "files-menu" is properly implemented.
- [ ] Clean form input so only a tag will be created. No extra text.
- [ ] Stylize form.
