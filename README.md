# Multi-Tag

When installed, right-clicking on folder will bring up an option to add a tag to all notes within a folder. Upon clicking this, a message will pop up asking you to add a tag. Once confirming, the tag(s) will be added to the bottom of each note in the folder.

## Features Planned:

- [x] Add tag to all notes in folder.
- [x] Allow option to appear when multi-selecting files.(not everyone uses folders)

## Ideas for Features:

- [ ] Settings option for whether tag appears in YAML or bottom of file.

## Next Steps:

- [ ] Update obsidian typing so "files-menu" is properly implemented.
- [ ] Clean form input so only a tag will be created. No extra text.

When multi-selecting and then right-clicking, the console.logs that I set up within the event registration do not activate at all. Is multi-selecting considered a separate event?
